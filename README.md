# Albarumi(올바르미)

# ⚠️In Progress! Do not look closely through it...😣

## Purpose
Restarting for initially rejected idea for several contests, we decided to make a cross-platform app that helps people to find what they lost for each other, which is called Albarumi(means 'justness' in Korean).

## Goals

1. Make sure to design a better experience for users for accessability and convenience.
2. The application must be run in cross-platform(iOS & Android).
3. If possible, additional Progressive Web App should be created.

## Development Environment

- IDEs(Android Studio & XCode)
- Flutter(if needed)
